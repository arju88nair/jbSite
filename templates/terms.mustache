                <h3 class="lead">5. Membership closure &amp; refund of deposit</h3>
                <p class="colFooterText">To discourage ad-hoc and short term membership, members are required to comply with a minimum membership term of three months. For members who subscribe to plans with a refundable deposit, any premature closure of membership in less than three months from the date of sign-up, will result in the reading fee for the remaining period of the mandatory term getting adjusted against the deposit. The rest of the deposit, however will be refunded. For members who subscribe to annual plans without deposit there is no refund applicable at the time of closure. Under extreme situations caused by non-compliance to the Terms of Use by member, JustBooks clc reserves the right to terminate a membership for any or no reason without any refund.</p>
                <h3 class="lead">6. Unclaimed Refundable Deposit</h3>
                <p class="colFooterText">Upon expiry of membership, JustBooksclc sends reminders over emails/sms to its members for renewal. Three months after expiry, JustBooksclc reserves the right to classify the account as &#8216;Dormant&#8217; and initiate steps to recover cost of books and any unpaid reading fee from the refundable deposit, if there is no action on the reminders, which would be communicated to the member through email/sms. Post this recovery, any excess deposit left in the account will be retained as &#8220;Unclaimed&#8221; refundable deposit for a period of 3 months and periodic reminders would be sent to the member to claim the same. After 12 months of expiry of membership, JustBooksclc reserves the right to treat the member as &#8220;not reachable&#8221; and take appropriate action on the unclaimed refundable deposit if there has been no response from the member on the reminder communications.</p>
                <h3 class="lead">7. Definition of a <span class="caps">BOOK</span></h3>
                <p class="colFooterText">Since the reading fee is a flat rate and is not linked to the number of books read in a period, it is important to note that each title catalogued in JustBooksclc gets the same treatments irrespective of size, cost &amp; target reader. Children’s books are treated the same way as other books.</p>
                <h3 class="lead">8. Membership Card</h3>
                <p class="colFooterText">Each member of JustBooksclc will get a <span class="caps">RFID</span> based membership card. No transaction at the library will be allowed without this card. Reporting a loss of card or rending a card unfit for use through willful/intentional or unintentional means will attract a replacement cost of Rs.100/- per card. Multiple cards for the same number can be obtained by paying an amount for Rs.100/- per extra card.</p>
                <h3 class="lead">9. Temporary suspension of membership</h3>
                <p class="colFooterText">Through a feature called &#8220;Subscription Holiday&#8221;, JustBooksclc allows the member to pause the membership (temporary suspension), for a duration of 1 month, 2 months or 3 months before expiration of membership. During Subscription Holiday period, a member will not be able to use the library. To utilise this feature, a member is required to fill up the Subscription Holiday Form either at the branch or online. All issued books and magazines should be returned to the JustBooksclc branch before the start date of Subscription Holiday. Members who pay for Yearly and Half-yearly terms will receive free Subscription Holidays of 2 months and 1 month respectively, and are required to pay Rs. 50/- per month there after. Quarterly members are required to pay Rs. 50/- per month to avail the feature.</p>
